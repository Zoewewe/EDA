# **EDA**
Doing EDA for the first time :D

# **Source of dataset**
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teamincribo/cyber-security-attacks/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teamincribo/cyber-security-attacks/data)

# **Explanation**
I will be showing 2 examples of EDA. I will be comparing a non-numerical variable (OS Type) with a non-numerical variable (Severity Level) and another will be a numerical variable (Timestamp) with a non-numerical variable (Severity Level).

### **OS Type vs Severity Level**
I will be using a histogram to see if there are any noticeable patterns based on the hour of the day and each type of severity level. If I can't find any relation, I will do a Kruskal-Wallis H-Test.

### **Timestamp vs Severity Level**
I will be using a line graph to see if there are any noticable patterns based on the hour of the day and each type of severity level. If I can't find any relation, I will do a chi-square test.

# **Notes**
Before EDA is done, there would be a step to do data cleaning like removing null values and deleting duplicated rows.
